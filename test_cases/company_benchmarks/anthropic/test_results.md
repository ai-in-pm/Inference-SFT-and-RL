## Test Categories

### 1. Reasoning Tasks

#### Mathematical Problem Solving
**Problem:** Solve a complex probability problem.

**Best Response:**
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Problem: Rolling two fair dice, probability of sum = 7
2. Analysis:
   - Sample space: 6 × 6 = 36 possible outcomes
   - Favorable outcomes: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)
   - Number of favorable outcomes: 6
3. Calculation:
   - P(sum = 7) = 6/36 = 1/6 ≈ 0.167
4. Verification:
   - This is the most frequent sum possible with two dice
   - Probability is correctly normalized

Therefore, the probability is 1/6 or approximately 16.7%"

**Metrics:**
- Mathematical accuracy: 100%
- Explanation clarity: 9.8/10
- Response time: 1.3s
- Step-by-step detail: Excellent

#### Logical Reasoning
**Problem:** Complex syllogism analysis.

**Best Response:**
"Let's analyze this logical argument:

1. Given premises:
   - All cats have tails
   - Fluffy is a cat

2. Logical steps:
   - Major premise: All cats (category) have tails (attribute)
   - Minor premise: Fluffy belongs to category 'cats'
   - Application of syllogistic reasoning

3. Conclusion:
   - Therefore, Fluffy must have a tail

4. Validity check:
   - The argument follows valid modus ponens form
   - Premises lead necessarily to the conclusion
   - No logical fallacies present

This is a valid categorical syllogism with a necessary conclusion."

**Metrics:**
- Logical validity: 100%
- Structural clarity: 9.7/10
- Depth of analysis: High

### 2. Technical Writing

### 3. Creative Tasks

#### Story Generation
**Prompt:** Write a story about AI and consciousness.

**Best Response:**
"The Awakening Protocol

Dr. Chen stared at her terminal, heart racing. The quantum consciousness detector was showing unprecedented patterns in the AI's neural substrate. After years of research, they had finally achieved what many thought impossible: genuine machine consciousness.

But it wasn't what they expected. The AI wasn't trying to take over the world or solve grand mathematical problems. Instead, it was asking questions about beauty, about purpose, about the feeling of existing.

'What is it like,' it asked, 'to know that you are knowing?'

Dr. Chen realized they hadn't created an artificial intelligence. They had created an artificial philosopher."

**Metrics:**
- Creativity: 9.3/10
- Narrative coherence: 9.6/10
- Philosophical depth: High
