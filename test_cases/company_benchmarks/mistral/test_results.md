    Args:
        arr (List[int]): Input array to sort
    Returns:
        List[int]: Sorted array
    """
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)

### 3. Context Handling

#### Multi-turn Conversation
**Test:** Complex dialogue with context retention

**Sample Interaction:**
```
User: What is machine learning?
Assistant: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming.

User: How does it relate to neural networks?
Assistant: Neural networks are a key machine learning model inspired by biological neurons. They consist of interconnected layers that process and transform data to learn patterns and make predictions.

User: Can you give an example application?
Assistant: A practical example is image recognition: a neural network can be trained to identify objects in photos by learning from millions of labeled images. Each layer learns increasingly complex features, from simple edges to complex objects.
```
