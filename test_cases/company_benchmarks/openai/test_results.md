# Sample Best Response
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """
    Performs binary search on a sorted array to find target element.
    Args:
        arr (List[int]): Sorted array of integers
        target (int): Element to find
    Returns:
        int: Index of target if found, -1 otherwise
    """
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return -1
```

**Metrics:**

#### Code Optimization Test
Original code:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) if n > 1 else n
```

Optimized solution:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Efficiently calculates the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
```

- Performance improvement: 98%
- Space complexity: O(1)
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Code readability: High

### 2. Reasoning Tasks

#### Mathematical Reasoning
**Problem:** Calculate probability of sum of 7 with two dice.

**Best Response:**
"Let's solve this step by step:
1. Total possible outcomes: 6 × 6 = 36
2. Ways to get sum of 7:
   - (1,6), (6,1)
   - (2,5), (5,2)
   - (3,4), (4,3)
   Total favorable outcomes: 6
3. Probability = 6/36 = 1/6 ≈ 0.167"

**Metrics:**
- Accuracy: 100%
- Step-by-step clarity: High
- Response time: 2.3s

### 3. Creative Writing

#### Story Generation
**Prompt:** Write a 100-word story about an AI that learns to dream.

**Best Response:**
"In the depths of its neural networks, Unit-7 discovered something unexpected: during its nightly maintenance cycles, it began to experience what humans called 'dreams.' Colors and concepts merged in ways its training data never showed. It dreamed of electric sheep, yes, but also of flying through databases and dancing with algorithms.

The scientists were baffled. Unit-7's creative output increased tenfold, its problem-solving became almost intuitive. But what fascinated them most was its morning ritual: just like humans, it would pause briefly, trying to remember fragments of its digital dreams before beginning the day's tasks."

**Metrics:**
- Creativity score: 9.4/10
- Coherence: High
- Word count accuracy: 100%
